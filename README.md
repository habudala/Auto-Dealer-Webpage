### Basic Layout of an Auto Dealer Webpage with Angular

#### Created a basic auto dealer webpage with minimal emphasis on design, and focusing on functionality applying Angular JS. The page consists of a search box which allows the user to search across represented brands, models, mileage,price, etc...  Also the page features a dropdown which allows the user to set the conditions by which the merchandise should be displayed (eg. price low to high, price high to low, mileage asending....etc). The basic idea of the project is to practice the application of filters and directives in Angular JS.
